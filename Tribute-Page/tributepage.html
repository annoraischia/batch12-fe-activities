                <strong>José Silva</strong> developed a method of tapping into the power of our minds to solve any problem, overcome any difficulty, and reach a consistent level of dynamic well-being.
                ESP is commonly known as "Extra-Sensory Perception", but for Silva, the more accurate term is "Effective Sensory Projection" to emphasize that all people have the capacity to reach and sustain a higher state of mental functioning that can activate enhanced awareness and even psychic abilities.

            <p>In 1953, Silva believed he had trained his daughter to be psychic, and he introduced his training methods to Rhine with his daughter as proof. Rhine's response was that Silva's daughter was a natural psychic and he just hadn't noticed it before. Subsequently, Silva began working with another subject. This time, he tested his subject first to be sure he was not functioning as a psychic. Over the next ten years, Silva claimed to have trained thirty-nine more subjects to be psychics.</p>

            <p>The Silva Method is now a multi-million dollar business with thousands of Silva Method instructors teaching the system over several days to groups of students in numerous countries worldwide.
                The system has also spawned many books, some of them authored or co-authored by José Silva, with many others based on the basic principles of the method but spreading into other areas of awareness and application whilst in the alpha state.</p>
