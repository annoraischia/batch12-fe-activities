                José Silva developed a method of tapping into the power of our minds to solve any problem, overcome any difficulty, and reach a consistent level of dynamic well-being.
                ESP is commonly known as "Extra-Sensory Perception", but for Silva, the more accurate term is "Effective Sensory Projection" to emphasize that all people have the capacity to reach and sustain a higher state of mental functioning that can activate enhanced awareness and even psychic abilities.
